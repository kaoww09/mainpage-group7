 <p align="left"> Starting from 2020 of march the world 
started to change due to one county that ate a non edible 
meat of an innocent animal. Because of that the world suffered
 on a disease called Covid 19.It is currently one of some deadly disease 
 that the people should stay home and be quarantined for 14 days. 
But there are still some bad news that came up this pass year 
along the lines of the death of one of the most famous basketball player
 Kobe Brayant and his daughter and one of the famous actor that played 
black panther in the movie avengers and other more.
 But in this year another variant of Covid 19 was found and way 
worse than the first one. And another bad thing that really happend
 is the the Philippines Health organization  has a debt of 7billion
 pesos and our country is currently at a big loss and the country had to give 
some of their oceans to China to pay for their debt.But we should always have hope.

 <p align="left"> We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.
 As a Lasallian community, and as a people of the society, may we continue to reach out 
to those who may have forgotten the light that shines above. There’s light in this darkness, 
all we need is to look up. Don’t ever think of giving up!.
At the end of the day all we need is hope and strength. Hope that it will eventually get better
 and strength to hold on till it does.  And while we are waiting, whatever hardship, challenges,
 indecisions and fears that we are facing, we just remember that these too shall pass and by the 
grace of God we will overcome. To everyone, we hope that they continue to trust God that what we 
do today we will always be fine at the end, and they will all be in the future. Just remember
 that tomorrow is still full of wonderful possibilities for all of us.
